# write-json-rust

This Rust project demonstrates how to serialize Rust data structures into JSON format using the `serde` and `serde_json` crates. It provides a basic example of creating and serializing a JSON structure.

## Usage

### Installation

Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. If not, you can install them from [Rust's official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

### Clone the Repository

You can clone this repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codescalper/write-json-rust.git
```

### Build and Run

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd write-json-rust
```

Build and run the project with Cargo:

```bash
cargo run
```

The program creates an example `Article` structure, serializes it into JSON, and prints the JSON representation to the terminal.

## Importance

This project serves as a starting point for serializing Rust data structures into JSON format. It's valuable for developers who need to work with JSON data in Rust applications.

## Where to Use

1.  **Data Serialization**: You can use this project as a reference for converting your Rust data structures into JSON for storage, exchange, or communication with other systems.
2.  **Web APIs**: It can be used in web applications to generate JSON responses when building APIs.

For more information on using the `serde` and `serde_json` crates, please refer to the [official documentation](https://serde.rs/).
